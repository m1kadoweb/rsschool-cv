1. Summary. 
I was always interested in the IT direction and everything related to this area. I decided at school that in the future I would work in the IT industry. At that time I got acquainted with HTML with the help of which I built simple web pages. After graduation, I went to work as a software testing engineer. At the moment, my goal is to study Front End development and find a job in this area. There is also a goal in the field of testing - this is automation, which is also interesting to me.
